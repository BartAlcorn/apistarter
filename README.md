# GO API starter kit

This is a bare bones, no frills, just "git'er done" webserver/api starter kit.

It is NOT production ready, but as a bootstrap it's acceptable.

There is zero security. Add it here or front end it ([AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), for example), but you've been warned.
