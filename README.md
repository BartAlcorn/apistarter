# GO API starter kit

This is a bare bones, no frills, just "git'er done" webserver/api starter kit.

It is NOT production ready, but as a bootstrap it's acceptable.

There is zero security. Bake it in here as middleware or add a front end ([AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), for example), but you've been warned.

## routing

`routes` and `routesv1` show two different methods of defining routes. This also shows how to easily version routes.

## person

`person` is an over simplified package for processing a person structure.
